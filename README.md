# Statistical Analysis of Temperature Trends in Oahu for June and December

## Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of this analysis is to examine the temperature trends in Oahu for the months of June and December between the years 2010-2016. This analysis is being conducted to determine if a surf and ice cream shop in Oahu can be sustainable year-round, given the temperature trends in June and December.

## Results:

The mean temperature in June (74.9°F) is higher than the mean temperature in December (71.0°F).
The standard deviation of temperatures in June (3.3°F) is smaller than the standard deviation in December (3.7°F).
The minimum temperature in June (64.0°F) is higher than the minimum temperature in December (56.0°F).

## Summary:
Based on the analysis of temperature trends in Oahu for June and December between 2010-2016, there are notable differences in weather between these two months. While the mean temperature in June is higher than December, the minimum temperature in June is also higher than December. However, the standard deviation of temperatures in June is smaller than December, indicating less variation in temperatures in June.

Two additional queries that could be performed to gather more weather data for June and December are:


Precipitation data: Precipitation can also affect the number of visitors to the shop. Collecting data on precipitation levels for June and December can help to determine if there are any seasonal differences that could impact the business.

Wind speed data: Wind speed can have a significant impact on the surf conditions and can affect the number of surfers who visit the shop. Collecting data on wind speed for June and December can help to determine if there are any significant differences that could impact the business. 

These impacts are additionally variable in consideration that climatic differences are becoming more extreme and changing the world over due to global warming. Many of these could be adverse.

However, surfing relies on a certain level of wind and from favorable offshore directions to create the waves relied upon by surfers.  
For example, the tenth The Eddie Aikau Big Wave Invitational, in January of 2023 in Waimea Bay, Hawaii, which sported 50–60-foot waves this year. 
This event is not annual but conditional—requiring minimally 30-foot waves in order to be held.

This underscores that surfing is not going away but the climatic factors affecting it need to be watched closely.
